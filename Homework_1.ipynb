        "**Your recommendation:** My  recommendation is to hire 6 full-time tellers and 5 part-time tellers. The computer model calculated that the bank ideally needs about 5.7 full-time employees to meet demand at the lowest cost. Since you cannot hire a fraction of a person, I rounded this up to 6 full-time tellers to ensure you are never understaffed. I also recommend hiring the maximum allowed number of part-time tellers 5 because they are cheaper ($5/hour) and provide the flexibility needed to cover the busy afternoon rush 3–5 PM without paying for unnecessary coverage in the morning."
